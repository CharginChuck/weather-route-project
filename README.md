Weather Route Project

Description:
This project takes in user input for Origin, Destination, and Hours Until Departure.  It takes the origin/destination and feeds them into the google maps API to get route data.  It then uses that route data with the OpenWeatherData.org API to get weather data along the route and returns locations and estimated times that you may encounter incliment weather. 

Dependencies:
You will need a creds.py file with WEATHER_API_KEY and GOOGLE_API_KEY variables
